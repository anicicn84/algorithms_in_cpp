# algorithms_in_cpp
Bunch of algorithms with tests in C++

The list will be updated. 
Every new implementation of an algorithm is in a separate .hpp file in a separate namespace. 
Every implemented algorithm has a separate unit test file and out of it executable generated.
Feel free to add more test cases.

## How to run?
Clone the project and inside it make the build folder `mkdir -p build` if on Unix. 
Go inside and run `cmake ..` (you need to have CMake installed). 
Then run `make -j4` or on how many cores you want to build. 
Run some of the executables for unit tests or play around with the algorithms in main.
